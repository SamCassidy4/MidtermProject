<h1>About</h1>

<p> Welcome to our website "MealMagic" we created this website as a midterm project for our class Skill Distillery. This project tested our full stack skills using the lessons we learned over the course of some months.
We practiced a coding sprint in order to produce the best possible product within the week and a half we had to do this. The members of our group are: Kna Kong, Pamela Leon, and Sam Cassidy. Thank you for taking the time to visit,'
below is a bio from each of us.</p>

<h3> Sam Cassidy</h3>
 My name is Sam Cassidy, I was born and raised in Denver Colorado. I attended University of Northern Colorado and Colorado State University to recieve a degree in psychology
with an emphasis in mind, brain, and behavior. I spent some years as a Sous Chef working in Old Town Fort Collins. I managed one of the busiest restaurants there until I decided I wanted a change of pace
This is where I began attending Skill Distillery an online bootcamp which has taught me how to be a full-stack java developer. I have always liked computers and learning how different entities whether it be computers
or people talk to each other. Not a day goes by where I don't enjoy coding and learning what it means to be a great software developer. Thank you for taking the time to visit our website. Take a look at my github profile if you like
what you see here.

<h3>Kna Kong</h3>
<p>
Our team spent a tumultuous week sprinting for Meal Magic. Jumping into the deep end sometimes is worth it.
For this project, I'ved learned a great deal. When I'm not learning a new stack or spending hours peer-programming, you can find me looking for another adventure with an endless list of hobbies.
My passion is gathering new experiences and getting good at everything. Thanks for checking out our project!

<h3> Pamela Leon </h3>
<p>
Hi, I'm Pamela Leon and I currently reside in Colorado where I was born and raised. Before joining the program my main background was being
in the medical field. I always wanted to get myself into the tech world but never knew where to start until I enrolled into Skill Distillery. Being in the program with 
zero coding experience has been a challenge but each topic that we learn in class each day has me more excited to become a full-stack developer. I love the technical and philosophical perspective of coding and I am looking 
forward to entering the software developer world. Thank you for taking a look a our website!
