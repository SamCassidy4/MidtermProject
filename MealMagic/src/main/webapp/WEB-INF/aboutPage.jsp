<strong>Kna Kong</strong>
<br>

Our team spent a tumultuous week sprinting for Meal Magic. Jumping into the deep end sometimes is worth it.
For this project, I'ved learned a great deal. When I'm not learning a new stack or spending hours peer-programming, you can find me looking for another adventure with an endless list of hobbies.
My passion is gathering new experiences and getting good at everything. Thanks for checkout our project!
