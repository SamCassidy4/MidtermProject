<h1>About</h1>

<p> Welcome to our website "MealMagic" we created this website as a midterm project for our class Skill Distillery. This project tested our full stack skills using the lessons we learned over the course of some months.
We practiced a coding sprint in order to produce the best possible product within the week and a half we had to do this. The members of our group are: Kna Kong, Pamela Leon, and Sam Cassidy. Thank you for taking the time to visit,'
below is a bio from each of us.</p>

<h3> Sam Cassidy</h3>
 My name is Sam Cassidy, I was born and raised in Denver Colorado. I attended University of Northern Colorado and Colorado State University to recieve a degree in psychology
with an emphasis in mind, brain, and behavior. I spent some years as a Sous Chef working in Old Town Fort Collins. I managed one of the busiest restaurants there until I decided I wanted a change of pace
This is where I began attending Skill Distillery an online bootcamp which has taught me how to be a full-stack java developer. I have always liked computers and learning how different entities whether it be computers
or people talk to each other. Not a day goes by where I don't enjoy coding and learning what it means to be a great software developer. Thank you for taking the time to visit our website. Take a look at my github profile if you like
what you see here.
