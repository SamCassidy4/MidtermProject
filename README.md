# Overview
This MealMagic application was designed to help a user search for exsisting recipes by findiing them by name or single ingredients that are readily available. User can also create a profile where they can create a new recipe and upload it into the database. Users can also rate and comment on each recipe they find. If the user is missing an ingredient then they are able to add a new ingredient and add it to their recipe. 

# Description
Upon entering the website, user can search for a recipe by ingredient by selecting the checkboxes on what ingredients they already have in their kitchen. A list of recipes will appear as to what recipes have the following ingredients the user choose.
User can also search a recipe by searching for their favorite recipe name as well.

However, for user to be able to rate, add recipe or add ingredient they must create an account or login. 

Once user is logged in, they are able to see their own profile with full name and created date. If a user is wishing to delete their account, they can do so on their profile page. 

Users can also see their favorite recipe once logged in. 

User can see all recipes we have in the database, if they do not see a recipe they like they can add a new recipe. They are prompted with a form to describe their recipe in great detail. They can even choose where their recipe is from, what category it is under and the dietary preference of that recipe. If the user does not see a country, category or dietary preference of their choosing then they can add each one of them first and then coming back to the create recipe page where they will see their newly added preferences. 

When user is done they can simple log out and all of their changes are saved.
